-certain events need to not have local variable (set range, eg)
--do this by disabling the tabs, have an attribute, pass it through

-tag parameters and make them undeletable

-saveInstanceState not fully implemented
--returnResponse is problematic because it's not serializable. It needs to be changed to a constant
