General:
-saveInstanceState not fully implemented
--returnResponse is problematic because it's not serializable. It only works if it's a static class, not anonymous
-choose whether actors/objects/events should be deletable
-map selector (oh yeah.. that)
-server
-make sure rendering stops on pauses
-support resource loading (update ContentProvider)
-versioning - that'd be cool!

Behaviors:
-export
-map

Events:
-rework placement of map event editor to go along with behaviors theme
-rename actions when var names change
-reset instead of resize global variables
-copy/paste
-add bunches more!
