-saveInstanceState not fully implemented
--returnResponse is problematic because it's not serializable. It only works if it's a static class, not anonymous
-choose whether actors/objects/events should be deletable
-map selector (oh yeah.. that)
-server
-make sure rendering stops on pauses
-support resource loading (update ContentProvider)
-versioning - that'd be cool!
