General:
-loading a newer version of PlatformGame than you know about
-saveInstanceState not fully implemented
--returnResponse is problematic because it's not serializable. It only works if it's a static class, not anonymous
-choose whether actors/objects/events should be deletable
-game playing stops on pause
-support resource loading (update ContentProvider)
-versioning - that'd be cool!

Behaviors:
-export
-map
-sometimes behaviorinstanceeditor doesn't save (long click?)

Events:
-help functions would be lovely
-rework placement of map event editor to go along with behaviors theme
-rename actions when var names change
-reset instead of resize global variables
-copy/paste
-add bunches more!

Actors:
-zoom change: keep actor in box

Map Editor:
-better layer icons

Hero:
-decide how to handle non-hero games...

Map Properties:
-finalize how to add/remove bgs
-resize should move events!!

Tilesets Editor?

Objects:
-actually edit them

UI:
-choose color/skin
-add more controls?

Game:
-implement behaviors
-saving/pausing
